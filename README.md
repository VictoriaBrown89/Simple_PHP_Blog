# Simple_PHP_Blog
I created a simple blog using PHP.

Technologies used:
* XAMPP
* PHP
* MySql
* Apache
* Eclipse
* HTML
* CSS

Using XAMPP, I created a local virtual server to house two online databases. Using PHP and MySql, I created a blog website which displays blog that I've posted. As the administrator, I have the option of adding more blogs using HTML/CSS to develop text boxes and buttons.
